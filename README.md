# Predictive Modeling Customer Attrition <br>
In the Preliminary Results, the development and evaluation of initial machine learning models 
were conducted, following the steps outlined in the Analytic Plan.  This Final Report builds on 
those findings by refining the predictive models and implementing advanced modeling 
techniques to help the ABC Corporation identify customers at high risk of attrition.  Model 
performance is compared to select the most effective approach, and the most important 
predictors of customer attrition are highlighted.  Based on these insights, actionable 
recommendations are provided to help ABC Corporation retain at-risk customers.  Finally, next 
steps - including areas for improvement and strategies for ongoing model maintenance, are 
outlined to ensure long term model effectiveness and reliability.
